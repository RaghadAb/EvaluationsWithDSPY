Here's a step-by-step approach to help domain owners determine the optimal DMARC policy:\\n\\n1. **Identify Existing Email Services**: Compile a list of all email services used by the domain, including mail servers, email service providers, third-party email marketing platforms, and anti-spam or email filtering services. Document the IP addresses and hostnames associated with each email service.\\n\\n2. **Analyze Email Flows and Potential Forwards**: Map out the email flows within the domain, considering incoming and outgoing email flows, as well as potential email forwards from subdomains to central mail servers or external services. Identify any potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by spammers or phishers.\\n\\n3. **Assess the Need for Security vs. Deliverability**: Evaluate the domain's security requirements, considering regulatory compliance, industry standards, and historical abuse or phishing activity. Balance these security requirements with deliverability concerns, taking into account legitimate email services and the potential impact on email deliverability and reputation.\\n\\n4. **Determine the Optimal DMARC Policy**: Based on the analysis, determine the optimal DMARC policy for each subdomain. Consider policies such as None (monitoring only), Reject (rejecting unauthenticated emails), Quarantine (quarantining unauthenticated emails), or Reject with percentage (rejecting a percentage of unauthenticated emails). Start with a gradual implementation approach, initially using the None policy and gradually increasing the policy strength as needed.\\n\\n5. **Implement and Monitor DMARC**: Implement the chosen DMARC policy for each subdomain using the relevant DNS records TXT or XML. Monitor DMARC reports to track authentication results, identify potential issues, and adjust the policy as necessary. Utilize DMARC analytics tools like DMARC Analyzer, Agari, and Dmarcian to gain insights into email authentication and potential abuse.\\n\\nTools and Methods to Aid in DMARC Policy Determination:\\n- **DMARC Analytics Tools**: DMARC Analyzer, Agari, Dmarcian\\n- **Email Authentication Testing Tools**: SPF Wizard, SPF Validator, DKIM Validator, DKIM Wizard\\n- **Email Flow Visualization and Analysis Tools**: Lucidchart, Draw. io, Loggly, Splunk\\n\\nBy following this structured approach and leveraging the recommended tools and methods, domain owners can determine the optimal DMARC policy for their domain with multiple subdomains, effectively balancing security with deliverability and ensuring the authenticity and trustworthiness of their emails.\"\n",")"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":25}],"source":["output"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"scrolled":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jFNlfIB3HWe8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738642614270,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":3937,"user":{"displayName":"Raghad Abdulrab","userId":"15604699956986515149"}},"outputId":"34bdb431-8884-48c8-87b9-37ad6dfb5892"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{\n","    \"explanation\": \"The answer provided is accurate, as it correctly outlines the steps necessary to determine the optimal DMARC policy for a domain with multiple subdomains, aligning with email security standards.
